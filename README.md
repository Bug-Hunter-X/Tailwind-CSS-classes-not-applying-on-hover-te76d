# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying on Hover
This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly on hover. The expected behavior is that the background color should change when hovering over the div element. However, this is not happening.

## Bug Description
The problem is observed when using the `hover:` modifier in Tailwind classes. The `bg-red-500` class is applied initially, but the `hover:bg-blue-700` class does not take effect on hover.

## Solution
The issue is resolved by ensuring the Tailwind CSS configuration and build process are properly set up. The solution provides a corrected version of the code and steps to ensure Tailwind is correctly configured.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server (or build the application if applicable).
